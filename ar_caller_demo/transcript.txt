Payer Rep: Hi, thank you for calling Aetna. My name is Sam. How may I assist you today? 
AI AR Caller: Hello, my name is Jenny from Allegan General Hospital. I'm calling to check the status of a claim for one of our patients. 

Payer Rep: Sure, I can help you with that. Can you please share your callback number before we proceed?
AI AR Caller: Of course. My callback number is 469..26..26..953. 

Payer Rep: Thank you so much. Now, can you please provide your NPI number? 
AI AR Caller: Sure. The NPI number is 129..580.3.3.7.7. 

Payer Rep: All right, thank you very much. Can I please get the patient's member ID? 
AI AR Caller: Certainly. The patient's member ID is AWFBC223-567890.

Payer Rep: All right, thank you. Can you please confirm the patient's name and date of birth? 
AI AR Caller: Sure. The patient's name is John Doe, and the date of birth is June 12th, 1990. 

Payer Rep: All right, thank you so much for all that information. Now, how can I help you? 
AI AR Caller: I'd like to check the status of a claim for this patient with the date of service December 11th, 2024. 

Payer Rep: Sure, December 11th, 2024. Can you please confirm the billed amount? 
AI AR Caller: Yes, the billed amount is 1,637 dollars. 

Payer Rep: Great. I was able to locate the claim and the claim status is denied. 
AI AR Caller: I see. Could you please provide the denial reason along with the claim received date and denial date? 

Payer Rep: The claim was denied because there was no authorization on file. 
AI AR Caller: Got it. Could you please provide the claim received date and denial date? 

Payer Rep: Yes, the claim submission date is December 13th, 2024, and it was denied on January the 5th, 2025. 
AI AR Caller: Thank you for that information. I do have an authorization number on file 7654321. Could you please reprocess the claim using this authorization number? 

Payer Rep: Let me check. Can you please repeat that authorization number and please read it out slowly? AI AR Caller: Of course. 7..6..5..4..3..2..1. Please confirm if you got that correctly. 

Payer Rep: I got that. I was able to look up the authorization number and it's not valid for this claim.
AI AR Caller: I see. Could you clarify why the authorization number is not valid for this claim? 

Payer Rep: The authorization number is not valid for the date of service. 
AI AR Caller: Thank you for clarifying. Since the authorization number is not valid for the date of service, could you check if there was a hospital claim billed on the same date where an authorization number is present? If so, can you use that for reprocessing? 

Payer Rep: I was not able to find any other authorization number for any hospital claims for the same date of service. 
AI AR Caller: Understood. In that case, is it possible to obtain retro-authorization for this claim? 

Payer Rep: I'm sorry, we don't support retro authorizations. 
AI AR Caller: I understand. In that case, would an appeal be the appropriate next step? 

Payer Rep: Sure, yeah. You can submit an appeal. 
AI AR Caller: Could you provide the fax number or mailing address for submitting the appeal? 

Payer Rep: The fax number is 855...411..9633. 
AI AR Caller: Thank you. Could you also provide the deadline for submitting the appeal? 

Payer Rep: The deadline is 90 days from the date of denial. 
AI AR Caller: Got it. Before we wrap up, could you provide the claim reference number and a call reference number for this conversation? 

Payer Rep: Sure. The claim reference number is 202...415...37982 and the call reference number is 71..398. 
AI AR Caller: Thank you for that information. 

Payer Rep: Is there anything else I can help you with? 
AI AR Caller: No, that's all. Thank you for your help. Have a great day.
